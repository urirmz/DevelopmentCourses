// Splice 
// splice() allows us to do just that: remove any number of consecutive elements from anywhere in an array.
// splice() can take up to 3 parameters, but for now, we'll focus on just the first 2. The first two parameters of splice() are integers which represent indexes, or positions, of items in the array that splice() is being called upon. And remember, arrays are zero-indexed, so to indicate the first element of an array, we would use 0. splice()'s first parameter represents the index on the array from which to begin removing elements, while the second parameter indicates the number of elements to delete. For example:
// let array = ['today', 'was', 'not', 'so', 'great'];
// array.splice(2, 2);
// Here we remove 2 elements, beginning with the third element (at index 2). array would have the value ['today', 'was', 'great'].
// splice() not only modifies the array it's being called on, but it also returns a new array containing the value of the removed elements:
// let array = ['I', 'am', 'feeling', 'really', 'happy'];
// let newArray = array.splice(3, 2);
// newArray has the value ['really', 'happy'].
// you can use the third parameter, comprised of one or more element(s), to add to the array. This can be incredibly useful for quickly switching out an element, or a set of elements, for another.
// const numbers = [10, 11, 12, 12, 15];
// const startIndex = 3;
// const amountToDelete = 1;
// numbers.splice(startIndex, amountToDelete, 13, 14);
// console.log(numbers);
// The second occurrence of 12 is removed, and we add 13 and 14 at the same index. The numbers array would now be [ 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 ].
// Here, we begin with an array of numbers. Then, we pass the following to splice(): The index at which to begin deleting elements (3), the number of elements to be deleted (1), and the remaining arguments (13, 14) will be inserted starting at that same index. Note that there can be any number of elements (separated by commas) following amountToDelete, each of which gets inserted.

// Slice() copies or extracts a given number of elements to a new array, leaving the array it is called upon untouched. slice() takes only 2 parameters â€” the first is the index at which to begin extraction, and the second is the index at which to stop extraction (extraction will occur up to, but not including the element at this index). Consider this:
// let weatherConditions = ['rain', 'snow', 'sleet', 'hail', 'clear'];
// let todaysWeather = weatherConditions.slice(1, 3);
// todaysWeather would have the value ['snow', 'sleet'], while weatherConditions would still have ['rain', 'snow', 'sleet', 'hail', 'clear'].
// In effect, we have created a new array by extracting elements from an existing array.

// Spread operator 
// ES6's new spread operator allows us to easily copy all of an array's elements, in order, with a simple and highly readable syntax. The spread syntax simply looks like this: ...
// In practice, we can use the spread operator to copy an array like so:
// let thisArray = [true, true, undefined, false, null];
// let thatArray = [...thisArray];
// thatArray equals [true, true, undefined, false, null]. thisArray remains unchanged and thatArray contains the same elements as thisArray.
// Another huge advantage of the spread operator is the ability to combine arrays, or to insert all the elements of one array into another, at any index. With more traditional syntaxes, we can concatenate arrays, but this only allows us to combine arrays at the end of one, and at the start of another. Spread syntax makes the following operation extremely simple:
// let thisArray = ['sage', 'rosemary', 'parsley', 'thyme'];
// let thatArray = ['basil', 'cilantro', ...thisArray, 'coriander'];
// thatArray would have the value ['basil', 'cilantro', 'sage', 'rosemary', 'parsley', 'thyme', 'coriander'].
// Using spread syntax, we have just achieved an operation that would have been more complex and more verbose had we used traditional methods.

// indexOf()
// Since arrays can be changed, or mutated, at any time, there's no guarantee about where a particular piece of data will be on a given array, or if that element even still exists. Luckily, JavaScript provides us with another built-in method, indexOf(), that allows us to quickly and easily check for the presence of an element on an array. indexOf() takes an element as a parameter, and when called, it returns the position, or index, of that element, or -1 if the element does not exist on the array.
// For example:
// let fruits = ['apples', 'pears', 'oranges', 'peaches', 'pears'];
// fruits.indexOf('dates');
// fruits.indexOf('oranges');
// fruits.indexOf('pears');
// indexOf('dates') returns -1, indexOf('oranges') returns 2, and indexOf('pears') returns 1 (the first index at which each element exists).
